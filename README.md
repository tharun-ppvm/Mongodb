# Mongodb

1. Aim:

The aim of the Product Catalog with MongoDB project is to develop a full-stack web application where users can view, add, update, and delete products. This system helps manage product details efficiently using MongoDB as the database and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for interaction.

2. Features:

--Add New Products: Users or admins can add new products with name, price, description, and category.

--View Products: Displays a list of all available products stored in the database.

--Update Product Details: Allows modification of existing product details like price, stock, or description.

--Delete Products: Option to remove products from the catalog.

--Search and Filter: Users can search products by name or filter by category.

--Responsive Interface: Frontend adjusts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

--MongoDB Integration: All product data is stored and fetched in real-time from the database.

--Error Handling: Handles missing fields, invalid entries, or failed database connections smoothly.

3. Technologies:

--Frontend (Optional – if included)

HTML / CSS / JavaScript: For creating the basic UI for adding, viewing, and managing products.

React.js (optional): For building a dynamic frontend with real-time updates and smooth navigation.

--Backend

Node.js: JavaScript runtime used to build the backend logic and API endpoints.

Express.js: Web framework to manage routes (like /add, /update, /delete, /view) easily and efficiently.

--Database

MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store product information (like name, price, stock, category, etc.).

Mongoose: ODM library for connecting and interacting with MongoDB using simple JavaScript models.

Authentication & Security (Optional – if admin login is added)

bcrypt.js: For hashing admin passwords securely.

dotenv: For storing sensitive information such as database URLs and secret keys.

cors: To handle cross-origin requests safely.

4. Project Flow:

--User/Admin opens the product catalog web app.

--Add Product Form collects product details (name, price, category, etc.).

--Backend API stores the details in MongoDB.

--View Page fetches and displays all products.

--Edit/Delete Options allow modification or removal of products.

--Search/Filter features enhance user experience.
